# 🛒 E-Commerce Shipping Prediction using Classification Algorithm

A machine learning project focused on predicting shipping delay likelihood for e-commerce orders by using classification models, order-logistics data, and engineered features.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end workflow: ingestion of order and logistics data (e.g., order date, ship date, product category, destination region), exploratory analysis to identify key shipping predictors, feature engineering to transform variables, training classification models, and evaluating performance. The objective is to classify whether a shipment will be delayed and provide actionable insight to reduce lead-time risks.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Collection

Dataset containing order details: order date, ship date, delivery region, carrier, product size/weight, and a target variable indicating whether the shipment was delayed.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution of delayed vs on-time shipments
* Visualisations of delay incidence by carrier, region, product weight, and time of year
* Correlation matrix among variables
* Identification of missing values, outliers, and patterns in delay occurrences

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Encoding categorical variables (e.g., carrier, product category, destination region)
* Creating derived features such as shiplead time (ship date – order date), product-weight ratio, holiday vs non-holiday flag, season bucket
* Normalising/scaling numerical features to suit classification algorithms
* Splitting dataset into train/test sets with stratification to maintain delay class balance

### 4. Modeling

Classification algorithms used:

* **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
* **Random Forest Classifier** (strong performer)
* **(Optionally) Gradient Boosting / XGBoost** for enhanced accuracy

### 5. Evaluation

Key metrics employed:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC
* Feature importance analysis

**Result:** The Random Forest (or chosen classifier) achieved the best performance in predicting shipping delays, highlighting lead-time, carrier, and destination region as significant factors.

### 6. Prediction & Insights

* Generated delay-predictions for unseen orders
* Analysed feature importance: e.g., shorter order-to-ship lead times, certain carriers and remote destinations had higher delay risk
* Provided actionable recommendations: prioritise high-risk orders, optimise carrier allocation, improve lead-time buffers in logistics planning

## 📈 Key Findings

* Orders with smaller order-to-ship lead times and remote destination regions show higher delay risk
* Carrier choice and product weight/size also influence shipping delay probability
* Engineered features (lead-time, seasonality, destination region) significantly improved classifier performance
* The predictive model provides logistics teams with early warning for risky shipments

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time tracking data (e.g., carrier status updates, weather/traffic conditions) to enhance prediction accuracy
* Incorporate ensemble stacking, deep learning or time-series approaches to capture hidden patterns
* Deploy the model via a web interface or internal dashboard to monitor and flag high-risk orders in real-time
* Implement feedback loop to retrain and recalibrate the model with live data from logistics systems
* Assess model fairness and performance across geographic regions and product types
